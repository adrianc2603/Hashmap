# Hashmap
## By Adrian Currington

### Description
This hashmap is resizeable and expands when the number of elements is 66% that of the current capacity. Collisions are also dealt with using separate chaining.

### Files Includes
- main.h: Header file for my hashmap.
- main.c: Implementation code for my hashmap.
- tester.c: Tester code to test the functionality of each method in main.c.

### Run On Your Machine
I ran this with the following inputs to the command line:
1. gcc tester.c main.c
2. ./a.out
